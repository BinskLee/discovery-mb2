# UART

Our microcontroller (like most) has a peripheral called a UART (for "Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter). This peripheral can be configured to work with several serial communication
protocols. The peripheral we will be working with is named UARTE (for "UART with Easy DMA", a topic
outside the scope of this chapter).

Throughout this chapter, we'll use serial communication to exchange information between the
microcontroller and your computer.
