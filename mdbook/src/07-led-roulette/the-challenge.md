# The challenge

You are now well armed to face our challenge! Again, your application should look like this:

<p align="center">
<video src="../assets/roulette_fast.mp4" width="500" loop="true" autoplay="true"/>
</p>

If you can't exactly see what's happening here it is in a much slower version:

<p align="center">
<video src="../assets/roulette_slow.mp4" width="500" loop="true" autoplay="true"/>
</p>

If you need a hint, `templates/solution.rs` provides a mostly-filled-out chunk of code to finish. I
would suggest you try it on your own first, though: it should be doable by nowâ€¦

Got it?
