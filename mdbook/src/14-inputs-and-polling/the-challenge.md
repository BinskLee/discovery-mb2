# The challenge

Now it’s your turn to put polling into practice. Your task is to implement a simple program that uses button polling to display directional arrows based on user input:

- If Button A is pressed, display a left arrow (←) on the LED matrix.
- If Button B is pressed, display a right arrow (→) on the LED matrix.
- If neither button is pressed, display a single lit LED at the center of the matrix.

You'll need to:

- Initialize the LEDs and buttons.
- Continuously poll Button A and Button B.
- Update the LED display according to the button state with a clear indication of each state (left, right, or neutral).

I hope you don't mess up, it's so hard to share the road with people who don't use their turn signals properly.
