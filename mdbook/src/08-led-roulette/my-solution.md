# My solution

What solution did you come up with?

Here's mine. It's probably one of the simplest (but of course not most beautiful) ways to generate
the required matrix:

``` rust
{{#include src/main.rs}}
```

One more thing! Check that your solution also works when compiled in "release" mode:

``` console
$ cargo embed --release
```

If you want to debug your "release" mode binary you'll have to use a different GDB command:

``` console
$ gdb ../../../target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/led-roulette
```

The Rust compiler modifies the machine instructions generated in a release build (sometimes by a
lot) in order to try to make the code faster or smaller. Unfortunately, GDB has a hard time figuring
out what is going on after this. As a result, debugging release builds with GDB can be difficult.

Binary size is something we should always keep an eye on! How big is your solution? You can check
that using the `size` command on the release binary:

``` console
$ cargo size --release -- -A
    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
led-roulette  :

Your numbers may differ somewhat depending on how your code is built: this is OK.

Know how to read this output? The `text` section contains the program instructions. The `rodata`
section contains read-only data stored with the program instructions. The `data` and `bss` sections
contain variables statically allocated in RAM (`static` variables).  If you remember the
specification of the microcontroller on your micro:bit, you should notice that its flash memory is
less than double the size of this extremely simple binary: can this be right?  As we can see from
the size statistics most of the binary is actually made up of debugging related sections. However,
those are not flashed to the microcontroller at any time â€” after all they aren't relevant for the
execution.
